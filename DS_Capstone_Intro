Imagine you whant to open a new restaurant, cafe or a snackbar in Moscow, Russia. First, you need to choose a right place for the business. 
It is here that the geo-data (i.e., Foursquare etc.) and a little DataScience magic come to help.
In this project we aim to rank the districts ('boroughs') of Moscow in terms of eating-out faciliies availability and visualize that as a map.
The task can be broken down into a few steps:
1. get the districts borders as a geodataframe
2. download population data for each district
3. download a list of all cafes/restaurants and other eating-out faculities in Moscow and link each of the premises to a particular district
4. calculate a seat availablitity measure (=aggregate number of seats in all premises / population) for each district
5. rank the districts in terms of the results from (4) 
6. create a "heat-map" of Moscow with districts colored corresponding to seats availablity
